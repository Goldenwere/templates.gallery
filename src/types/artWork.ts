/**
 * An `artWork` is a greater piece of art with various details pertaining to it.
 * An `artWork` can contain `variants` that can be navigated deeper down into a gallery to explore said `variants`,
 * or will open a preview of the piece if it does not contain `variants`.
 * 
 * Technically every variable can be undefined, however this will just lead to generic placeholders being added that do nothing.
 * At minimum, `url` *OR* `variants` (which eventually filter to `artWork` with urls) should be defined,
 * unless using for the featured artwork on the home page, in which only thumbnailUrl and optionally title needs to be defined.
 * 
 * When an `artWork` is read into the gallery, it is modified to contain an _id, which is a UUID generated
 * based off a combination of the `title`, `url`, `thumbnailUrl`, and `date`.
 * It is assumed that you will only use a `thumbnailUrl`/`url` once within a hierarchical level of variants.
 * Between levels, `thumbnailUrl` can be re-used.
 * For example, at the root level of a gallery, each `artWork` has a different thumbnail.
 * One `artWork` has variants, and one of those variants re-uses the same thumbnail used at the root.
 * This variant doesn't change in title/date/url. While this would generate the same UUID, it won't collide with anything
 * due to it being nested.
 * The only point of collision would be if you defined 2+ `artWork` with the same exact `title`, `url`, `thumbnailUrl`, and `date`,
 * or lack of definition thereof,
 * all within the same hierarchical level (e.g. the root gallery).
